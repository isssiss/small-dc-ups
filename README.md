# Small DC UPS for Home Assistant/Frigatenvr project

This is designed to power Asrock J1900M-ITX board with a PicoPSU automotive power supply with an input voltage 8...36V.
Mains power is provided by a laptop power supply with 19.5V output.

Backup battery is a 12V 9Ah lead acid gel battery (Ultracell UL-9-12).

Charger is a traditional standby current and voltage limited linear model.

Can be used with standard Network UPS Tools (NUT) with a blazer_ser driver and Megatec ascii protocol.

NOTE: I made only one pcb and the first version had an error. The error is corrected only in the schematic and v2 pcb image.
